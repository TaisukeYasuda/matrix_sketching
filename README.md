# Sketchy

Sketchy is a high level library that acts as a wrapper for various
matrix implementations in C++ designed to support matrix sketching operations
on both CPU and GPU backed libraries.

**Matrix sketching** is a new and exciting topic in Machine Learning. The basic concept in sketching is that we can perform matrix operations such as inversions, svd, and eigenvalue decomposition much faster by forgoing some accuracy. However there are theoretical guarantees that our approximation is within some set threshold from the true value.

Many of these normal matrix operations perform in O(n^3) time, and as such do not scale well. By parallelizing them and using the new algorithms on a GPU, we will hopefully drastically speed up matrix decomposition time. 

Our library also provides a easy to use, general interface design that
can easily be extended to incorporate other matrix libraries, such as
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [Elemental](http://libelemental.org/)

## Libraries Supported
1. [Boost](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/numeric/ublas/doc/)
2. [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html)
3. [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl)
4. [NVBLAS](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvblas/) <\br>
Obviously, these are necessary to use our library

## Linking
All of our interfaces are written as header files. As such, assuming
above libraries are installed, you just have to link our project directory 
along with whatever is needed to implement the matrix of your choice

## Documentation
Documentations are autogenerated using doxygen
If you have it installed, simply run 
```
doxygen
```
All the documents will be generated in docs folder

## Progress
- [x] Release 0.8: Matrix Sketching, Wrappers for cuBLAS, easy interface to load csv files onto GPU
- [x] Release 1.0: Matrix Inversion using sketching, Linear Regression
- [ ] Release 1.2: SVD using sketching, maybe Kernel PCA (we need to figure what that is)

## Tests
Each library was tested using well known values for accuracy
Speed test was also performed, with the result documented
in docs folder
